Help me to create SOLID principle:
-prompt: i want to make SOLID principle for my document, please explain to me the detail of this principle, and what should i do
-result: Sure! The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are especially useful in object-oriented programming and are often followed when writing clean, scalable, and testable code.

         Here's a breakdown of what each principle means, with guidance on what you should do when applying it in your document or code:

         ðŸ”¹ 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
         Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

         What You Should Do:

         Break your classes into smaller, more focused units.

         If a class handles multiple tasks (e.g., data management and UI rendering), separate those tasks into different classes.

         Each class should do only one thing well.

         Example:
         Instead of having a UserManager class that handles user login, registration, and database interaction, create:

         UserAuthenticator

         UserRegistrationService

         UserRepository

         ðŸ”¹ 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
         Definition: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

         What You Should Do:

         Write your classes in a way that allows new functionality to be added through inheritance or composition rather than changing existing code.

         Use interfaces or abstract classes to allow future extensibility.

         Example:
         If you have a PaymentProcessor class, use an interface like PaymentMethod and implement new methods like CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, etc., without touching the main processor logic.

         ðŸ”¹ 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
         Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

         What You Should Do:

         Ensure that subclasses override the behavior of a parent class in a way that does not break existing code.

         Donâ€™t override methods in a way that changes their expected behavior.

         Example:
         If you have a Bird class with a fly() method, and a Penguin subclass canâ€™t fly, then Penguin should not inherit from Bird. This violates LSP.

         ðŸ”¹ 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
         Definition: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

         What You Should Do:

         Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

         Each class should implement only the interfaces it needs.

         Example:
         Instead of a big interface like:

         java
         Copy
         Edit
         interface Worker {
           void work();
           void eat();
         }
         Create:

         java
         Copy
         Edit
         interface Workable {
           void work();
         }

         interface Eatable {
           void eat();
         }
         Let classes implement only what they need.

         ðŸ”¹ 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
         Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

         What You Should Do:

         Depend on interfaces or abstract classes, not concrete implementations.

         Use dependency injection to provide required objects to your classes.

         Example:
         Instead of this:

         java
         Copy
         Edit
         class Light {
           Switch sw = new Switch(); // tightly coupled
         }
         Use:

         java
         Copy
         Edit
         class Light {
           Switchable switchable;

           public Light(Switchable switchable) {
             this.switchable = switchable;
           }
         }
         Where Switchable is an interface.

         âœ… Summary Table for Your Document
         Principle	Description	What You Should Do
         SRP	One class = One responsibility	Break classes into focused components
         OCP	Extend behavior without modifying existing code	Use abstraction, inheritance, or composition
         LSP	Subclasses should behave like their parent class	Ensure consistent behavior in subclassing
         ISP	Don't force classes to implement unused methods	Use multiple, small, specific interfaces
         DIP	Rely on abstractions, not concrete classes	Use dependency injection and interfaces

         If you're including this in your document (like a project report, code standard, or design doc), you should:

         Briefly define each principle.

         Provide code snippets or architecture diagrams showing how you applied them.

         Explain the benefits in your project: e.g., easier to test, update, or maintain.
